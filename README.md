# NewFrameworkTemplate

A preconfigured template for new framework projects with batteries included.

Specifically this is what "battries included" currently means:

- There's a sensible `.gitignore` for Swift projects included (based on [GitHub gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Swift.gitignore))
- Targets are configured for iOS, macOS, tvOS & watchOS (just remove what you don't need)
- SwiftLint is preconfigured to help embrace a unified code style
- Support for [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) and [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager) is setup
- A `README.md` file is setup with appropriate sections
- A `LICENSE.md` file is setup with MIT license preconfigured

## Getting Started

Here's a few simple steps on how you can use this project to kick-start your next framework project:

1. **Clone this repo** to your own Git server / GitHub fork
2. **Configure git-flow** with `productive`, `stable`, `work/` and `deploy/`
3. Run `brew bundle` in the command line and wait for **tools to be installed**
4. Run `beak run initialize --frameworkName YourFrameworkName` to **initialize the project**
5. Set the the **Development Team** to yours (at least in the test targets)
6. Set the **project organization** on the right pane (Flinesoft by default)

Additional options you probably want to check:

7. **Remove the targets and schemes** you are not planning to develop for (all Apple platforms by default)
8. Configure the **minimum deployment target** per target (the latest major version by default)

That's it! Start coding. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ˜Š
