# NewFrameworkTemplate

A preconfigured template for new framework projects with batteries included.

Specifically this is what "battries included" currently means:

- There's a sensible `.gitignore` for Swift projects included (based on [GitHub gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Swift.gitignore))
- Targets are configured for iOS, macOS, tvOS & watchOS (just remove what you don't need)
- SwiftLint is preconfigured to help embrace a unified code style
- Support for [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) and [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager) is setup
- A `README.md` file is setup with appropriate sections
- A `LICENSE.md` file is setup with MIT license preconfigured

## Prerequisites

To use this framework, you need to install a few tools:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh): `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
- [Beak](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Beak): `brew tap yonaskolb/Beak https://github.com/yonaskolb/Beak.git && brew install Beak`
- [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage): `brew install carthage`
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint): `brew install swiftlint`


## Getting Started

Here's a few simple steps on how you can use this project to kick-start your next framework project:

1. **Clone this repo** to your own Git server or **download as ZIP file** (beware)
2. Run `beak run initialize --projectName YourFrameworkName --organization "Your Organization"` to **initialize the project**
3. Set the the **Development Team** to yours (at least in the test targets)
4. Update the **author and social_media_url** entires in the .podspec file

Additional options you probably want to check:

5. **Remove the targets and schemes** you are not planning to develop for (all Apple platforms supported by default)
6. Configure the **minimum deployment target** per target (the latest major version by default)

That's it! Start coding. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ˜Š
